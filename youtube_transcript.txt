Have you been wondering how to train a model through teley operation for the booster soccer showdown? Each model outputs joint positions that are converted into joint torqus through a PD controller before submission. Start by installing the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. Next, collect your data through teleyoperation. Choose your environment and where you want to save your data set. Start the script and use your keyboard to control the robot. Once you're done, press escape to stop recording. Finally, train your model using the collected data and submit it for the competition.
and automatically save your data set. All data sets use a shared pre-processor to keep inputs consistent across environments. Now use your data set to train an agent. Pick your training algorithm. Set your parameters and start the process. Specify your agent and data set path. Your train policies will be stored in the XP folder. After training, test your model to see how it performs in the environment. Specify the folder where the model is saved and which model checkpoint you want to load. Specifying the epoch value and
data set location. If your model was trained in Jax, convert it to PyTorch so it can be submitted to SAI. Add the Jax to PyTorch script and specify the pickle file you want to convert to torch and choose an output name for your model. Your model will show up ready to use. Finally, load your model and submit it through the provided submission script. Your model will load and benchmark. After it's done, you'll see it appear on the SI platform, move from validating to running, and then complete benchmarking.
That's how imitation learning works inside SCAI from teley operation to submission in just a few steps.
